- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Micah.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in books, learning, coffee, creating, and travelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity and Python. I may not have a ton of practical experience, but my background in foreign languages has really helped me pick it up quickly. And most importantly, I'm having fun and enjoying the struggle. I hope you enjoy my projects!
