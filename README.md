- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @micaroni
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in books, learning, coffee, and travelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cybersecurity and Python. I am new to Python but really enjoying it. I may not have a ton of practical experience, but my background in foreign languages has really helped me pick it up quickly. I hope you enjoy my projects!
